Notes:

This script is still being developed. Currently, it grabs all the MAC
addresses on an HP Procurve switch and filters out which ones have a
single device connected to them. In the future it will except a file 
exported by DHCP in order to generate a CSV file which will provide a 
quick and easy view of the devices connected to a network, their MAC 
address, IP address, hostname and which switch port they are plugged 
in to.
